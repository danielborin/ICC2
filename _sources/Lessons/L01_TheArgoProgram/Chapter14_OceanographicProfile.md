## What is an oceanographic profile?

Each of the temperature and salinity data sets measured from 2000 meters depth to surface is called an oceanographic profile, which is why the Argo floats are also known as "profilers".  Usually in oceanography observations are refered to the pressure level in decibar. The decibar is a multiple of the unit bar (bar) for pressure; the prefix deci (d) is a factor of one tenth or 0.1. Per this definition, one decibar is 0.1 bars. The decibar is represented by the symbol *dbar*. The bar is a metric unit of pressure defined as 100,000 Pa (100 kPa), though not part of the International System of Units (SI) is widely used in oceanography since you can get a rough idea of the depth in meters just looking the pressure in dbars and the rule of thumb than 1 meters is 1 dbar. 

In the following video you will find a detailed explanation and some examples:

Therefore and argo float will measure Conductivity, Temperature, and Pressure, this is, *CTD profile* and we refer to the sensor as a *CTD*. From the CTD we can obtain also the salinity.  Here there is an Sketch of a profile:

#### Argo has been revolutionary

Argo represents a revolution in ocean observation, since it provides data, freely and free of charge, at a  rate 20 times higher compared to traditional methods on board oceanographic records. Here we present some more interesting facts:
