# The Argo Online School
Argo is an international program that collects information from inside the ocean using a fleet of floats that drift with the ocean currents. The floats move up and down between the surface and a mid-water level  measuring ocean variables, but spends almost all its life below the surface. Argo has been collecting more than 100,000 profiles per year since 2012, and nowdays [Argo](https://argo.ucsd.edu/) is the mayor component of the Global Ocean Observing System.

Given the amount of data gathered by the Argo network of floats, the associated documentation has grown considerably and therefore the goal of the Argo Online school (AOS) is to teach the basic foundations to use and understand the Argo data. The AOS does not attempt to show everything, since the Argo documentaion is available for a more in deep learning. 

The AOS is a set of videos and hands-on jupyter notebooks designed to be accessible for hight shcool or graduate students in any discipline, with no prerequisites. The AOS is organized in three main sections:

[1. The Argo Program](https://euroargodev.github.io/argoonlineschool/Lectures/L01_TheArgoProgram/C10_TheArgoProgram_intro.html)
In this section and using a set of video ...
* What is the Argo network?
* Why do we need Argo and what are its objectives?
* How the observations are done?
* What is an oceanographic profile?
* Technological innovations
* Recap Lesson 1


[2. The Argo Data](https://euroargodev.github.io/argoonlineschool/Lectures/L02_TheArgoData/C10_TheArgoData_intro.html)
In this section and using a set of video ...
* The Argo General Data Stream
* What are the Argo data and its format?
* Real-Time and Delayed mode data.
* Where can I get access to data and how is it organized?


[3. Using the Argo data](https://euroargodev.github.io/argoonlineschool/Lectures/L03_UsingArgoData/C10_UsingArgoData_intro.html)
In this section and using hands-on jupyter notebook

## Acknowledging Argo data

Since data are freely available without restriction, to track uptake and impact, we ask that where Argo data are used in a publication or product, an acknowledgement be given. 

The Argo Data Management Team assigns Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) to Argo documents and datasets. These can easily be included in publications and keeps a direct and permanent link to the Argo document or data set used in that publication (to ensure reproducibility). The data sets are archived in monthly snapshots each with its own DOI. To acknowledge Argo, please use the following sentence and the appropriate Argo DOI afterwards as described below.

*“These data were collected and made freely available by the International Argo Program and the national programs that contribute to it.  (https://argo.ucsd.edu,  https://www.ocean-ops.org).  The Argo Program is part of the Global Ocean Observing System“*
