# Argo Online School

Argo is an international program that collects information from inside the ocean using a fleet of floats that drift with the ocean currents. The floats move up and down between the surface and a mid-water level  measuring ocean variables, but spends almost all its life below the surface. Argo has been collecting more than 100,000 profiles per year since 2012, and nowdays [Argo](https://argo.ucsd.edu/) is the mayor component of the Global Ocean Observing System.

Given the amount of data gathered by the Argo network of floats, the associated documentation has grown considerably and therefore the goal of the Argo Online school (AOS) is to teach the basic foundations to use and understand the Argo data. The AOS does not attempt to show everything, since the Argo documentaion is available for a more in deep learning. 

The AOS is a set of videos and hands-on jupyter notebooks designed to be accessible for hight shcool or graduate students in any discipline, with no prerequisites.
