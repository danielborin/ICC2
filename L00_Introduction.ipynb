    "# Argo Online School\n",
    "\n",
    "The Argo Online school is a set of videos and hands-on jupyter notebooks to describe the minimum requiremets to use and understand, the Argo data. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can access the hands-on content as here, in a [JubyterBook](https://euroargodev.github.io/argoonlineschool), or download it and use in your local machine. In that case, you should create a python environment to use these notebooks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since using some of the packages of this notebooks may give problems due to compatibility problems between conda-forge packages and packages contained in the default conda channels, I will recommend to set up `channel_priority: strict` and give priority to the `conda-forge` channel over the default channels when installing things. There are two ways of doing that. Either you always specify `conda install -c conda-forge` or you create a .condarc file in your home with this content:\n",
    "```\n",
    "channels:\n",
    "  - conda-forge\n",
    "  - defaults\n",
    "channel_priority: strict\n",
    "```\n",
    "An environment should either use conda-forge or not, from creation to destruction. Do not mix and match. If you created it without using the conda-forge channel, then do not add it to the mix halfway. In practice, I always create an environment with conda-forge unless in very specific cases where I found incompatibilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create and activate the AOS environment\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda env create -n AOS -f environment.yml \n",
    "conda activate AOS\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "if any library is missed you should install them using, for instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install netcdf4\n",
    "pip install xarray\n",
    "pip install seawater\n",
    "```\n",

    "This enviroment already includes the last stable version of [argopy](https://argopy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), the python library for Argo data.\n",

    "## Data used in the Argo Online School\n",
    "\n",
    "If you download the notebooks you should create a ./Data* folder to include the files used for the examples. The files in the Data folder can be dowloaded from [here](https://www.oceanografia.es/argoonlineschool/Data/) or directly from its source using _wget_, for instance:\n",
