One year after the data were observed it is, if necessary, adjusted and made public, this data is called *Delayed Mode* (DM). We will begin by focusing in the real time data, and in section [Adjusted data](https://euroargodev.github.io/argoonlineschool/L50_AdjustedData.html) we will describe how the data is adjusted."

It begins with a *R* since it is the real time data, if it began with an *D* it would be adjusted data, or Delayed Mode data; we will see and example in section [**ACTUALIZAR**]. \n",

    "Additionally some argo floats, as 6901254, also made obserations in the first descent from the surface to the parking depth, in this case the name of the files with this data would be **R6901254_001D.nc**.  \n",
