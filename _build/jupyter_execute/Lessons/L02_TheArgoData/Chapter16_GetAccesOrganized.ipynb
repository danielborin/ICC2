    "Each data will have a specific quality flag assigned that indicates its status! Both Real-Time quality control and Delayed - Mode quality control follow a solid quality flag policy. Here are some examples that show how robust this quality flag policy is:\n",
    "\n",
    "• The value assigned by a test cannot override a higher value from a previous test. Taking the Real-Time quality control as an example: a QC flag ‘4’ (bad data) set by Test 11 (gradient test) cannot be decreased to QC flag ‘3’ (bad data that is potentially correctable) set by Test 15 (gray list).\n",
