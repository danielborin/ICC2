    "The Argo Data Management Team assigns Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) to Argo documents and datasets. These can easily be included in publications and keeps a direct and permanent link to the Argo document or data set used in that publication (to ensure reproducibility). The data sets are archived in monthly snapshots each with its own DOI. To acknowledge Argo, please use the following sentence and the appropriate Argo DOI afterwards as described below.\n",
