# Introduction to the use of Argo Data
As indicated in the introduction, the third componente of the Argo Online School is  hands-on, and it is based on jupyter notebooks:

## The hands-on component of the Argo Online School

You can access the hands-on content as here, in a web-page, build using [JubyterBook](https://euroargodev.github.io/argoonlineschool), or download the jupyter notebooks and use them in your local machine. 

The hands-on component of the Argo Online School was developed using JupyterLab, since it contains a complete environment for interactive scientific computing which runs in your web browser. Jupyter is an open source python project, and as a very useful first aproach to python and jupyterlab, you can use [An Introduction to Earth and Environmental Data Science](https://earth-env-data-science.github.io/intro) and [Research computing in earth Sciences](https://rabernat.github.io/research_computing/) developed by [Ryan Abernathey](https://ocean-transport.github.io/) and [Kerry Key](https://emlab.ldeo.columbia.edu/index.php/team/kerry-key/).

In the case that you decide to download and run the python jupyter notebooks in your local machine, you should create a python environment. Since using some of the packages may give problems due to compatibility problems between conda-forge packages and packages contained in the default conda channels, I will recommend to set up `channel_priority: strict` and give priority to the `conda-forge` channel over the default channels when installing things. There are two ways of doing that. Either you always specify `conda install -c conda-forge` or you create a .condarc file in your home with this content:
```
channels:
  - conda-forge
  - defaults
channel_priority: strict
```
An environment should either use conda-forge or not, from creation to destruction. Do not mix and match. If you created it without using the conda-forge channel, then do not add it to the mix halfway. In practice, I always create an environment with conda-forge unless in very specific cases where I found incompatibilities.

To create and activate the AOS environment, that already includes the last stable version of [argopy](https://argopy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), the python library for Argo data, you should:

```
conda env create -n AOS -f environment.yml 
conda activate AOS
```

If by any chane, a library is not included in  environment.yml should install it using, for instance:

```
conda install netcdf4
conda install xarray
conda install seawater
```


### Data used in the Argo Online School

If you download the notebooks you should create a ./Data* folder to include the files used for the examples. The files in the Data folder can be dowloaded from [here](https://www.oceanografia.es/argoonlineschool/Data/) or directly from its source using _wget_, for instance:

for the *Daily NOAA OI SST V2 High Resolution Dataset for 2019*:

`! wget ftp://ftp2.psl.noaa.gov/Datasets/noaa.oisst.v2.highres/sst.day.mean.2019.nc`

for the data from float 6901254:

`wget ftp://ftp.ifremer.fr/ifremer/argo/dac/coriolis/6901254/*`

or for the data in the north Atlantic for the 11th November 2019

`! wget ftp://ftp.ifremer.fr/ifremer/argo//geo/indian_ocean/2019/11/20191111_prof.nc`
