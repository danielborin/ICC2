    "In case that you decide to download and run the python Jupyter Notebooks in your local machine, you should create a python environment. Since using some of the packages may give problems due to compatibility issues between conda-forge packages and packages contained in the default conda channels, we recommend to set up `channel_priority: strict` and give priority to the `conda-forge` channel over the default channels when installing stuff. There are two ways of doing it. Either you always specify `conda install -c conda-forge` or you create a .condarc file in your home with this content:\n",

If you created it without using the conda-forge channel, then do not add it to the mix halfway. In practice, we always create an environment with conda-forge unless in very specific cases where we found incompatibilities.\n",
