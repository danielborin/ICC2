    "The Argo program guarantees free and quality data distribution to the entire scientific & operational community and the general public. Before that, data needs to be checked out through different controls to guarantee their homogeneity and quality within the established accuracy ranges (+/- 0.005ÂºC temperature and +/- 0.01 for salinity). \n",

    "The first control stage is the **Real-Time (RT) quality control** and the last stage is called the **Delayed - Mode (DM) quality control**. Therefore, the data that has gone through the RT quality control is called [**RT data**](https://euroargodev.github.io/argoonlineschool/L41_RTData.html) and the data that has gone through, both, the RT and DM quality controls is called [**DM data**](https://euroargodev.github.io/argoonlineschool/L41_DMData.html); although some times we also refer to this data as **calibrated data**\n",
