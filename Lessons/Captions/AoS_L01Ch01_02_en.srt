1
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,960
We are increasingly concerned 

2
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:10,920
about global climate change
 and its regional impacts.

3
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,720
Sea level is rising
 at an accelerating rate

4
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:17,240
of three millimeters per year. 

5
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:19,840
Arctic sea ice cover
is shrinking

6
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,640
and high latitude areas
are warming rapidly.

7
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,840
Extreme weather events
 cause loss of life

8
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:29,840
and enormous burdens
 on the insurance industry.

9
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:34,280
Globally, nine of the ten
warmest years since 1880

10
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:38,920
when instrumental records began,
where in the 21st century. 

11
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,000
These effects are caused
by a mixture of

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,600
long term climate change
and natural variability.

13
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:51,440
Their impacts are,
in some cases, beneficial.

14
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,760
Lengthened growing seasons,

15
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,880
opening of Arctic
shipping routes...

16
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,280
And in others, adverse.

17
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:05,720
Increased coastal flooding, 

18
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:10,120
extreme droughts, more frequent
 heat waves and weather events

19
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:13,040
such as severe
 tropical cyclones.

20
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,120
Understanding and eventually
 predicting changes in

21
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,120
both the atmosphere
and ocean

22
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:26,160
are needed to guide
international actions

23
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,440
to optimize governments policies 

24
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,960
and to shape
industrial strategies.

25
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,480
To make those predictions, 

26
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,480
we need improved
models of climate

27
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,520
and of the entire Earth system,

28
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,360
including socioeconomic factors.
