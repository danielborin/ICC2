00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:08,320
The core mission
of the Argo program

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,560
was to provide a real time
 improvement in capacity

3
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:14,880
and measurement of temperature
 and salinity across

4
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,040
the first 2000 meters of ocean
 depth, contributing thus

5
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:22,560
to a global description
 of the seasonal and interannual

6
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,960
variability of the upper part
 of the thermohaline circulation.

7
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,240
Thus, within the core mission,
 the main objective

8
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,600
focused on establishing
 a coverage of a profiler

9
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,720
every three degrees of longitude
 and three degrees of latitude

10
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:41,960
in the band of 60 degrees north
 to 60 degrees south.

11
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,840
Although continuous advancements 

12
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,840
in technology and hard
 work of the Argo community

13
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:50,280
are allowing the original core
 missions objectives to keep

14
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:54,440
growing and enabling
 us to explore even further.
