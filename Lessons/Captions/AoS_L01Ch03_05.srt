1
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:07,320
There are three Argo missions.

2
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:12,160
Core Argo, BGC Argo
and Deep Argo.

3
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:16,040
Core Argo is the temperature,
salinity, pressure

4
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:18,800
operational mission that
was the original goal

5
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,160
of the Argo program.

6
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:24,760
BGC Argo measures
biochemical parameters

7
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:27,240
and is in the pilot phase.

8
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:31,040
Deep Argo measures the
same parameters as Core,

9
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:34,480
but profiles are between
4000-6000 meters

10
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,240
and is also in the pilot phase.
