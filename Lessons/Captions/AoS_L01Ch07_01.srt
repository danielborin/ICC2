Well done!
through this lesson,

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:05,920
you have obtained basic
and solid information

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:08,480
about the international
Argo program.

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,560
We have to look at:
What the Argo network is about

5
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:14,160
its objectives,
how an Argo float works

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,920
and how it collects
information from the ocean. 

7
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,320
Although this cocepts
may seem quite simple,

8
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,480
they are essential
to get the initial approach

9
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,160
and to understand
the Argo program as a whole.

10
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,160
Would you like to find out more? 

11
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,120
See you in the next lesson.
