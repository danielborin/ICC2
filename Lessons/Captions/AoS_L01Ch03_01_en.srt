1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:03,360
Lack of sustained observations

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,120
of the atmosphere, oceans
and land have hindered

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,600
the development and
validation of climate models.

4
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:13,680
An example from an analysis
done prior to Argo

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,840
concluded that the current
 transporting heat northwards

6
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:20,480
in the Atlantic and influencing
 Western European climate

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,200
had weakened by 30%
 in the past decade.

8
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:27,880
This result has to be based on
 just five research measurements

9
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:29,760
spread over 40 years. 

10
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,240
Was this change part of
a trend that might lead

11
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,800
to a major change
in the Atlantic circulation?

12
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,720
Or due to natural variability 

13
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:38,960
that will be reversed
 in the future? 

14
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,120
Or is it an artifact of the
limited observations?

15
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:45,160
The use of Fargo data has been
remarkably successful

16
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:47,840
in observing climate variability
 and change in the ocean,

17
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,640
and the program is now
evolving to become part

18
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,200
of a more complete
observing system.
