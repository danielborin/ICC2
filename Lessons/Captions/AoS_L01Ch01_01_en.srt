Hello and welcome
 to the Argo Online School.

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:06,560
My name is Alberto
and In this course,

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,080
you will learn the basics 

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,320
of the Argo program
 for ocean observation.

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,160
Hi, my name is Pedro. 

6
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,400
We assume, since you
have joined this course

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,440
that you are somewhat familiar
 with the program or you have

8
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,280
somehow worked with data
 from some observation system

9
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:22,320
for different
scientific purposes. 

10
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,640
If this is not the case,
Don't worry.

11
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,080
But first of all,
 let us ask you,

12
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:30,320
why do you think that we need
marine environment data?

13
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,920
Why is it so important
to study the ocean?

14
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:36,080
Play the next video
 and find out. 

15
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:38,800
As we have seen, 

16
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,120
there's a need to understand
 how the ocean works

17
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,280
as it's a key player
 in the climate system,

18
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,600
but it's setting the oceans
 can be a challenging task

19
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,880
as they cover
 70% of the Earth's surface.

20
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,680
And not only that, the ocean

21
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,240
is about 4000 meters in 1999.

22
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,760
And you know, what is it
 that was taken 

23
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:01,840
by scientists to greatly improve
 the collection of observation,

24
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,800
to increase sampling on average
 in terms of time area?

25
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,360
That step forward with our goal.
