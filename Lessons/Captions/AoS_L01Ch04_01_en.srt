1
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,280
At this point,
you probably wonder

2
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:09,400
how the observations are done.

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:13,680
Well, the standard Argo float
 mission is a ten day cycle,

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,160
with most of the floats time

5
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:17,960
spent drifting along
with deep ocean currents,

6
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:20,160
followed by taking
a series of measurements

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,360
as it moves
back up (profiles)

8
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:24,080
to the ocean surface.

9
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,960
Once the float is on
 the surface, 

10
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,960
it gets its location
 often through GPS

11
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:33,600
and then communicates with
 the satellite to send its data

12
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,320
and receive any
new mission instructions.

13
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,440
For the majority
 of the Argo fleet, 

14
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:43,560
this surface interval is between
15 minutes and one hour.

15
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,680
After that, the float sinks
 to a drift depth of 1000 meters

16
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,360
for about nine days, 

17
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:54,120
and then the float sinks to
 its profile depth of 2000 meters

18
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,360
before slowly
 rising to the surface

19
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:59,920
while measuring conductivity,
 temperature and pressure.

20
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,320
This cycle repeats until
the float batteries die,

21
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:07,920
usually four or five years later.

22
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:12,800
Associated to the Argo network,
there is a set of mechanisms,

23
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,040
committees and virtual centers 

24
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,880
that are in charge of
all the data reference tasks,

25
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:21,800
from the moment it is acquired
via satellite to its publication

26
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,480
in less than twelve hours
 on the internet

27
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,320
and in the global
 telecommunications network.

28
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,320
All the data is public and free.
