1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:03,280
At this point, you're
probably wondering 

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:05,160
how the observations are done. 

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:07,400
We have seen
 the cycle of an Argo float

4
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:10,040
and how it measures
 oceanographic parameters.

5
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:11,800
But how does it work? 

6
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:14,320
What's inside
 this revolutionary device? 

7
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:15,400
Standard Argo floats

8
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,880
are devices that
weight around 20 kilos

9
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,640
an are, approximately,
2 meters high.

10
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,840
The dive vertically by
changing their buoyancy

11
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,720
so they can resurface
 and submerge. 

12
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,760
There is no propulsion
system at all

13
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:31,160
so their horizontal
movements are caused

14
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:33,960
by the currents
that carry them adrift.

15
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,680
They consist of three subsystems.

16
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:39,480
A hydraulic system that
controls the buoyancy

17
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,920
through an external
inflatable bladder

18
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,880
so that the profiler can
resurface and submerge.

19
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:48,040
A microprocessor
that collects and stores

20
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:51,160
the data from the sensors
until it can be transmitted.

21
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:53,640
And finally,
a data transmission system

22
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,520
that controls communication
with satellites.
