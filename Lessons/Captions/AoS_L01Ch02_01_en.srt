1
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:03,600
As we have seen, there's
 a need to understand

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,120
how the ocean works

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,240
as it's a key player
in the climate system,

4
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:10,400
but studying the oceans
can be a challenging task

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,960
as they cover 70%
of the Earth's surface.

6
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:15,560
And not only that,

7
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:18,840
the ocean average depth
is about 4000 meters.

8
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:22,400
In 1999 an innovative
step was taken 

9
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,680
by scientists to greatly improve
the collection of observations

10
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,680
through increased
sampling and coverage

11
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,120
in terms of time and area.

12
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:33,120
That step forward
was Argo.
