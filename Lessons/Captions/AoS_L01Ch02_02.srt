1
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:16,880
It is said that Jason sailed
the seas on an expedition

2
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,360
in search of the Golden Fleece. 

3
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:25,720
And that he was not alone. 

4
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:28,520
He recruited the greatest
Greek heroes at the time,

5
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:30,560
including Hercules
from Boeotia,

6
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,840
the Dioskouroi twins from Sparta

7
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:35,840
or Kalais and Zetes
the sons of Boreas,

8
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,960
the North Wind. 

9
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,880
He was a favorite
 with the goddess Athena,

10
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:47,520
who had a great craftsman
 build a strong and fast boat

11
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,960
to help them on their quest. 

12
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,560
The Argo. 

13
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:01,320
Today, an international program
 collects information

14
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,120
from inside the ocean 

15
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,000
using a fleet of robotic
 instruments called floats

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,680
that drift with the ocean
 currents and move up and down

17
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,920
between the surface
 and a mid-water level.

18
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:18,160
The name chosen for
the program was Argo,

19
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:20,960
as the array of floats
 works in partnership

20
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,800
with the Jason Earth
 observing satellites

21
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,920
that measure the shape
of the ocean surface.

22
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:32,320
Each instrument spends almost
all its life below the surface

23
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,280
and they measure temperature
and salinity in the global ocean

24
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:40,160
providing key data
to detect changes in the ocean.

25
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:44,920
Roughly 4000 Argo floats are
currently deployed and operational

26
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:48,520
all over the Earth's oceans.

27
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:52,000
Access to data
 is completely open and free,

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,920
allowing any country, any public
 or private organization

29
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,880
and even any individual to
 explore the ocean environment.
