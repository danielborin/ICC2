1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,040
Every temperature and salinity
 set of data measured

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:07,320
from a depth of 2000 meters
 to the surface of the ocean

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:10,040
is called an
oceanographic profile.

4
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:11,800
This is why Argo floats 

5
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:15,200
are also known as
oceanographic profilers.

6
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,600
Taking into account
that salinity

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,600
is obtained from measurements
of conductivity in general,

8
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:25,160
a profile of temperature and
salinity is called a CTD profile,

9
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,480
where C stands for conductivity,

10
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:31,120
T for temperature
and D for depth,

11
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:34,280
since in a profile, all
measurements need to show

12
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,360
the depth they were
collected at.

13
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:40,080
Additionally, the sensors
 that measure CTD profiles

14
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:43,400
are commonly called
profiling CTDs

15
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,880
or simply CTDs.

16
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:48,440
The easiest way
to represent this is by

17
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:52,720
plotting the variable of any
Argo float against its depth

18
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,040
in such a way


19
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:57,440
that on the X axis we have
our desired variable

20
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,480
and on the Y axis,

21
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:03,040
the depth at which the desired
variable measurement was taken.

22
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:05,560
When reading the
oceanographic profiles,

23
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,800
we can obtain
relevant information

24
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,680
about the state
of the water column

25
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,920
from identifying masses of water

26
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,360
and monitoring
thermocline development,

27
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:18,400
to identifying ocean variability
 from seasons to decades

28
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,040
and even quantifying
 the ocean's heat content.
