00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:04,240
Argo is constantly
trying to improve

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:06,640
the quality and
coverage of its data, 

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,360
which means that
 some technological challenges

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,080
need to be addressed
 in order to have

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,400
floats operate well in all
parts of the global ocean.

6
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:18,040
Remember that almost all floats

7
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:20,840
are deployed into the ocean
and not retrieved.

8
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:25,840
Hence, the floats must be robust,
long lasting and accurate

9
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,800
in a sometimes very harsh
marine environment.

10
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,360
Continuous innovations in
technology and float design

11
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:36,800
have helped Argo improve
and expand its coverage.
