00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:04,320
The Argo program constitutes
a fundamental piece

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:07,000
inside the Global Ocean
 Observing System,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,200
and it is a joint initiative
of over 30 countries.

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:14,200
It is sponsored by the World
 Meteorological Organization,

5
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:17,400
the Intergovernmental
Oceanographic Commission,

6
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,480
the International
Science Council 

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,520
and the United Nations
 Environment Program

8
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:26,600
Argo contributes to the
Climate Variability

9
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,840
and Predictability
 Experiment project,

10
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,880
whose mission is to enable
a better understanding

11
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:34,320
of climate to the
benefit of society

12
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,680
and the environment
 in which we live. 

13
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:39,280
Argo is also a major contributor

14
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,320
to the Global Ocean Data
 Assimilation Experiment,

15
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,600
whose mission is to improve 

16
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,320
global and regional ocean
analysis and forecasting systems.

17
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,680
Overall coordination
 is provided through

18
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,640
the Argo Information Center,

19
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,400
an office associated to the World
Meteorological Organization

20
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,560
and the Intergovernmental
 Oceanographic Commission.

21
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:04,080
Each country that finances the
network does so voluntarily,

22
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,880
making the data obtained
freely available.
