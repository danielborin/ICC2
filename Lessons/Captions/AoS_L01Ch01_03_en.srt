1
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:05,200
Data from the marine environment
is a truly valuable asset

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:08,720
fast and secured access
to the information is vital

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,440
when dealing with threat
 to the marine environment,

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,480
in the development
of policies and laws

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,760
protecting vulnerable areas
in our coasts and oceans

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,280
so that we can understand
the tendencies

7
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:23,120
and are able to forecast
upcoming changes.

8
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:27,240
Unfortunately, the collection,
storage and access to marine data

9
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,640
has for many years
been fragmented.

10
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,200
There are organizations,
 systems, networks

11
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,440
and ocean observing
programs around the world

12
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,240
which observe the oceans, 

13
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,880
collect data according
to international standards

14
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,480
and make that information
freely available

15
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,120
as layers of interoperable
data and data products.

16
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,880
In this way, the
International Argo Program

17
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,880
 is a component of GOOS,

18
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:54,560
a highly collaborative and
multidisciplinary observing system

19
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:57,400
built around elements
of observation,

20
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:00,840
which are administered
and finance nationally. 

21
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,080
The main objective
of this course

22
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:06,040
is that you get used to data
 from the Argo network,

23
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:10,120
from the moment it is collected
until results are obtained.
