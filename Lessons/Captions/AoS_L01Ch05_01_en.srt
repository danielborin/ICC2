00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:04,880
Argo represents a revolution
 in ocean observations,

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:08,720
since it provides open and free
 access to data at a rate

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,200
which is 20 times higher when
compared to traditional methods 

4
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:15,080
used on board
oceanographic vessels.

5
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:18,760
Since 1999, the Argo
network has recorded

6
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:21,200
more than 2 million
 oceanographic profiles,

7
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,400
a figure equivalent
to three times that of

8
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,440
all the profiles recorded

9
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,520
since the beginning
 of oceanography 

10
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:30,120
in the early 20th century.
